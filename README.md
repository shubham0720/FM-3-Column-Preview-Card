# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component

![Design preview for the 3-column preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my first practice frontend project which helped me learn the dynamics of elements, centering div elements (Nightmare for all Frontend Devs :P), and many more concepts. 

Challenges faced:
  - Media Query for Responsive Web Design

I would appreciate any help provided to me to overcome the challenges which I am facing, or any tutorials in general. Thanks!
